# ISIFRACTALS

## Overview

This project aims at creating a tool to visualize the madelbrot set and julia fractals.

The code is split in two parts:
*__Python__: takes care of plotting of the data and creating gifs and other cool ways to visualize fractals

*__C++__: takes care of all the hard computation so everything goes really fast

It is also worth noting that python serves another purpose which is that of design. The workflow during the project was that of first writing working python code, then translating it to cpp for fast computation
